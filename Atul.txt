Hi Team, Could you please review it and rather sent offical warning and not fine.
There are following Reasons

1) I have been driving for 7 years in Australia and never done speeding so this was first time.

2) A its almost 2 months ago, if i recall I was going for my wife appointment and getting late. Also road at derrimut road near tarneit centre is being built and i was stuck there for 20-30 minutes due to heavy traffic, can be checked on google re constrcution of road. Usually hospital cancel the appointment if we late for even 5 minutes and she did not want to go again and again, also she was having pain. 

We also go for almost weekly appointment for blood test or ultrasound or midwife and didnt want to miss the appointment. Also as sometime they call over phone for appointment due to covid, i didnt have letter to attach at this moment for that day. For blood test they keep the referal with them.

After the road got cleared, i didnt see new speed limit of 60 and as i was getting late probably speeded a bit (68kmh) but quickly reduced as well after noticing it

3) I understand importance of safe driving and i appologize and assure that i will not do speeding in future.

Please consider my situation and seeing my past record please cancel this fine.
Please conver this as offical warning as one off.
 
Thank you,
Atul
